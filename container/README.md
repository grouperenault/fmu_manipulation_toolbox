# FMU Containers ?

An FMU Container is classical FMU which embeds other's FMU's. See [FMU Container](../doc/container.md)
for user documentation.

From API point of view, an FMUContainer can be seen as
* an FMU: see [](container.c) which implements the FMI API
* an fmi-importer which can load (see [`library.c`](library.c)) and interact with FMUs (see [`fmu.c`](fmu.c))

A configuration file `resource/container.txt` describe
* the container configuration (inputs, outputs, time step, options)
* the routing table which defines how the embedded FMUs are connected together

This file is generated by the `fmucontainer` command line tool.
See [`fmu_container.py`](../fmu_manipulation_toolbox/container.py) for details on how to create 
a container.

# Muti-Thread
If enabled through `MT` flag, each FMU has its own thread which
1. fetch its inputs from container buffer which is shared with all FMUs.
2. process `fmi2DoStep()`

Synchronization uses [`thread.c`](thread.c) facilities.

# Profiling 
If enabled through `profiling` flag, each call to `fmi2DoStep` of each FMU is monitored. The elapsed time
is compared with `currentCommunicationPoint` and a RT ratio is computed. A ratio greater than `1.0` means
this particular FMU is faster than RT. (See [`profile.c`](profile.c) for details)
