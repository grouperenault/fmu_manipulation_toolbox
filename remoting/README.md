# FMU-Remoting

## Rationale

Some OS can support 32-bits and 64-bits. Remoting feature adds a new interface to a existing FMU and let
the user mix bitness between fmi-importer and the DLL contained into the FMU.

## Implementation

Current implementation relies on Shared Memory and Semaphore. It is available on Windows and Linux only.
Primary OS is Windows.

This version supports:
   - ONLY FMI 2.0, ONLY for co-simulation mode
   - Strings are NOT supported

    participant importer as FMI-importer
    participant client as client.dll
    participant server as server.exe
    participant dll as model.dll
    Note over importer,dll: Initialization
    importer->>client: fmi2Initialize
    client->>+server: spawn
    server->>-client: acknowledge
    client->>server:RPC_fmi2Initialize
    server->>dll: load
    server->>+dll: fmi2Initialize
    dll->>-server: fmi2Component (server_t *)
    server->>client: status
    client->>importer: fmi2Component (client_t*)
    Note over importer,dll: Main loop until fmi2FreeInstance
    importer->>+client: fmi2SetXXX
    client->>-importer: status
    importer->>+client: fmi2GetXXX
    client->>-importer: values
    importer->>client: fmi2DoStep
    client->>server: values
    client->>server: RPC_fmi2DoStep
    server->>+dll: fmiSetXXX
    server->>+dll: fmi2DoStep
    dll->>-server: status
    server->>+dll: fmiGetXXX
    server->>client: values
    server->>client: status
    client->>importer: status
```

### Performances

To improve performance, this implementation minimize the number of Inter Process Communication calls. So that,
values of signal of the DLL are cached on client side in local buffers.


### How it's work ?

Considering win64 FMU, only the `binaries/win64` folder is populated. It contains `model.dll`.

#### Add remoting win32: simulate 64bits FMU 32 bits OS
  1. Copy `client_sm.dll` (32 bits) as `model.dll` in `binaries/win32`
  2. Copy `server_sm.exe` (64 bits) in `binaries/win64`
  
When Simulation Enviroment will use the FMU on 32 bits OS:
  1. it will load  `win32/model.dll` (which is a copy of `client_sm.dll`)
  2. which will communicate with `win64/server_exe`.
  3. which will load `win64/model.dll` 

#### Add remoting win64: simulate 32 bits FMU 64 bits OS
  1. Copy `client_sm.dll` (64 bits) as `model.dll` in `binaries/win64`
  2. Copy `server_sm.exe` (32 bits) in `binaries/win32`
  
  When Simulation Enviroment will use the FMU on 64bits kernel:
  1. it will load  `win64/model.dll` (which is a copy of `client_sm.dll`)
  2. which will communicate with `win32/server_exe`.
  3. which will load `win32/model.dll` 


## Usage with `fmutool`

This feature is available easily with `fmutool` command line or with its graphical user interface:
```fmutool -input model64.fmu -add-remoting32 -output model64+32.fmu```
